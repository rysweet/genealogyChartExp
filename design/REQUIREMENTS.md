# Genealogy Chart Application Requirements Specification

## 1. Overview
The application shall provide an interactive web interface for visualizing and managing family tree data through a circular chart format with an accompanying data management table.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Visualization
The application shall display a family tree using a circular format where generations are represented as concentric rings radiating outward from a central person. Each ring shall be divided into segments representing individual ancestors. The visualization must support up to eight generations while maintaining readable text that automatically sizes and wraps within segments. Text contrast must automatically adjust based on segment background colors, and selected individuals shall be visually highlighted. Users must be able to smoothly zoom and pan across the chart.

### 2.2 Data Management
The system shall support importing and exporting family data in GEDCOM format. Users must be able to save and load application state, including custom color configurations. Each person's record shall be editable with fields for first name, last name, birth date, death date, and custom background color.

### 2.3 Navigation
Users shall be able to designate any person as the center of the chart, with the display automatically reorganizing around the new central figure. The interface must provide controls for adding generations up to the maximum of eight, resetting zoom level, and panning across the chart. Clicking any segment shall open the edit interface for that person.

### 2.4 Color Management
Each person's segment shall support individual color customization through a Chrome-style color picker interface. Colors shall propagate through generations using an automatic gradient calculation system. The color picker must provide hex input, real-time preview, and click-away closure. The system shall automatically adjust text colors to maintain WCAG-compliant contrast ratios and persist color selections across sessions.

### 2.5 Font and Text Display
The system shall automatically size and wrap text within segments while maintaining readability. Multi-line text support must include configurable line spacing and automatic alignment. Font sizes shall never render below a minimum readable threshold, and all text must comply with WCAG contrast ratio requirements.

### 2.6 Person Edit Interface
The edit interface shall present as a modal form containing fields for personal information, parent selection, and color customization. The interface must include real-time validation, keyboard navigation support, and error handling. Users shall be able to set the edited person as the chart center or cancel changes by clicking outside the modal or using the escape key.

### 2.7 Data Table
The application shall provide a full-width data table matching the chart's dimensions. The table must support:
1. Real-time inline editing of person details
2. Automatic row highlighting for the selected person
3. Smooth scrolling to bring selected entries into view
4. A fixed header during scrolling
5. Responsive column sizing
6. Single-click editing with tab navigation
7. Automatic validation and save on blur

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
The application shall maintain smooth performance while handling up to 256 individuals across 8 generations. All UI updates, including zooming, panning, and text operations, must execute without noticeable delay.

### 3.2 Accessibility
All interface elements shall comply with WCAG accessibility guidelines, including proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility. The application must provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic markup.

### 3.3 Browser Support
The application shall function correctly on current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers, including their mobile variants. The interface must adapt responsively to screen sizes between 360px and 1200px width.

## 4. Interface Specifications

### 4.1 Control Panel
The application shall provide a consistent control panel containing clearly labeled buttons for importing, exporting, saving, loading, and manipulating the chart. Zoom controls must be easily accessible and intuitively positioned.

### 4.2 Chart Display
The chart shall maintain clear visual separation between generations while ensuring all person details remain legible. Transitions between states must animate smoothly, and the current selection shall be clearly highlighted without obscuring information.

### 4.3 Modal Interfaces
All modal interfaces shall implement:
1. Centered positioning with proper spacing
2. Clear visual hierarchy of information
3. Proper focus management
4. Backdrop overlay
5. Multiple dismissal methods (escape key, click outside, close button)
6. Z-index management to prevent overlay conflicts
