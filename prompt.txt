I need to make an app that displays genealogical data in a visualization using concentric circles. The center of the circles represents an individual, and each circle around it the next generation, hence each circle after the central one will be divided into a power of two (each individual has two parents). Each circle should display the name of an individual with some room for the years of their lifetime and should be clickable. If possible make the text of each arc segment wrap around the arc. The app should be built in react. Genreate sample data in a data file that can be read when the app starts up. The app should display ten genreations.
